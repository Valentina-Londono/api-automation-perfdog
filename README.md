# API Automation - PerfDog * . +

This project demonstrates **API test automation** using **Rest Assured**, **TestNG**, and **Maven**.
The purpose is to validate several functionalities of the [Swagger Petstore API](https://petstore.swagger.io/), following the requested requirements.

---

## Functionalities Tested

The following API features are automated:

1. **Create a user**
2. **Login** with a newly created user
3. **List pets** that have the status `"available"`
4. **Get details** of a specific pet
5. **Create a purchase order** for a pet
6. **Logout** from the application

Each functionality has its **own independent test class**. Tests are not chained, so they can be executed separately.
